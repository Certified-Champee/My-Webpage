		<h4><center><u>About me</u></h4>
			 <p>
				 Hello, I am David Gitau, a recent graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Computer Science.
				 I am a committed individual, with a strong work ethic, and I'm willing to go above and beyond to provide value to my employer.
				 I am interested in a school lead educator position, which involves instilling digital skills to rural primary school kids in Africa. 
				 This position will enable me to grow both my professional and technological skills as a digital enthusiast. 
				 Hence, I will strive to perform my roles to my best, to meet the needs and objectives of this position. <br>
				 Furthermore, I am passionate about helping kids because I grew up in a children's home since I was nine years old. While living there,
				 education was the best gift I was given, and it has shaped me into who I am today. Therefore, I would love to impact the lives of the less fortunate kids, as a way of giving back to the society.
				 This position will help me to achieve this objective by instilling digital skills that will serve them in their future life.

			<h4><center><u>My hobbies</u></h4>
			
			
			 <p>Besides my professional career, I am also an athlete. I play two sports known as Softball and Baseball. 
			 In February 2022, I had an opportunity to represent Kenya in the U23 Softball World Cup qualifiers in South Africa.
			 In addition, I was the most valuable player (MVP) in the 2023 National Softball League. These are key achievements I have gained through these sports,
			 which have largely impacted my life.
			 I believe sports activities are essential to improve oneâ€™s mental and physical health. <br> 
			 Moreover, I enjoy reading self development books, gym and home workouts, swimming, team building activities, and travelling. Cheers!
